# CSP.guru
An open-source database of all concentrating solar power plants of the world for energy modelers and analysts. This version of CSP.guru reflects the status of CSP projects as of 1st of July 2022.

## About
This dataset holds technical, economic, financial, and industrial data on all operating concentrating solar power stations and of stations under construction, as well as several pilot stations. For detailed description of the data collection procedure, please see the initial article for which the dataset was compiled [Lilliestam et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nenergy.2017.94).


## Data Package
We provide the data in form of a [tabular data package](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/tabular-data-package/) that consists of a CSV (comma separated values) file holding the actual data and a single JSON file (`datapackage.json`) holding the metadata. For quick analyses we also include a Microsoft Excel .xlsx file.

## Changes in this version of CSP.guru
This version of CSP.guru has been compiled by Richard Thonig in collaboration with the SolarPACES secretariat and reflects the CSP market in the middle of 2022. The Chinese market develops favorably with many new projects announced to be completed by 2024. At the end of 2021, the beam-down tower project was completed with 5 out of 15 initially planned towers completed.
Staying conservative, we only include those projects that are reported as under construction but keep a close eye for coming updates. In South Africa Redstone is finally under construction. Moreover, several pilot stations moved forward. We deleted three plants because we couldn't verify that they are under construction or will still be completed after the Chinese Feed-in-Tariff ran out at the end of 2021, thos are: OpenCSP_ID 132,133,134
"Shenzhen Jinfan Akesai - 50MW Molten Salt Trough", "Shouhang Yumen 100 MW Tower", "Supcon Delingha 135 MW Tower".
