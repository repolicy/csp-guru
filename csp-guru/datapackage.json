July 2022. For detailed description of the data collection procedure of CSP.guru, please see the original article [Lilliestam et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nenergy.2017.94).\n\n## Data Package\n\nWe provide the data in form of a [tabular data package](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/tabular-data-package/) that consists of a CSV (comma separated values) file holding the actual data and a single JSON file (`datapackage.json`) holding the metadata. In this version, as requested by csp.guru users, we added an Microsoft Excel .xlsx file for quick analysis holding the same data as the .csv \n\n## License and conditions\n\nThe licence of this data allows to share and adapt this data if you give appropriate credit, under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.\n\nFor academic and professional use (presentations, journal articles, reports, etc):if possible, please cite the source in which the present dataset was first used [Lilliestam et al.
